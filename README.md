# KGS Client

( See my blog at https://github.com/quantumf/kgsclient/wiki/Blog )

#Usage

Copy the contents of /src into the root of the KGS jsonClient webapps folder in your webapps (e.g. for Tomcat, you would copy the files to <folders>/Tomcat/webapps/jsonClient)

Note that the KGS jsonClient requires json.jar to be included, or somehow added to your webserver configuration.
